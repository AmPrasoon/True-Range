# True-Range
Time of arrival trilateration
-----------------------------

Problem statement:

Given a two-dimensional array of microphones installed on a 3:5m high ceiling with 2m spacing between them as shown in Fig. 1(a) in attached document. A mobile robot on the ground is moving in a circular path of radius 3m in anti-clockwise direction, centered at coordinate 9:0; 9:0 with a velocity of 1.5m/s. It has a speaker installed at 0:5m height, and emitting a infrasound pulse at 0:2 second intervals, which cannot be detected no further beyond 4:5m distance. We are required to write a program that would choose a set of microphone with the best DoP values for ToA trilateration. We also report a table composed of time, robot position, three chose microphones & their DOP (dilution of precision) values.
